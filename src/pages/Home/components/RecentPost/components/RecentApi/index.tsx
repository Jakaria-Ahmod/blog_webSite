      'From groundbreaking AI advancements to revolutionary renewable energy solutions, technology is transforming the way we live and work. These innovations not only shape our present but also define the future, creating opportunities for a better, smarter, and more sustainable world for generations to come.',
    descript02: `Google has been investing in AI for many years and bringing its benefits to individuals, businesses and communities. Whether it’s publishing state-of-the-art research, building helpful products or developing tools and resources that enable others, we’re committed to making AI accessible to everyone.,
`,
    descript03: `We’re now at a pivotal moment in our AI journey. Breakthroughs in generative AI are fundamentally changing how people interact with technology — and at Google, we’ve been responsibly developing large language models so we can safely bring them to our produড়cts. Today, we’re excited to share our early progress. Developers and businesses can now try new APIs and products that make it easy, safe and scalable to start building with Google’s best AI models through Google Cloud and a new prototyping environment called MakerSuite. And in Google Workspace, we’re introducing new features that help people harness the power of generative AI to create, connect and collaborate.`,
    descripton04: `More than 3 billion people already benefit from AI-powered features in Google Workspace, whether it’s using Smart Compose in Gmail or auto-generated summaries in Google Docs. Now, we’re excited to take the next step and bring a limited set of trusted testers a new set of features that makes the process of writing even easier. In Gmail and Google Docs, you can simply type in a topic you’d like to write about, and a draft will be instantly generated for you. So if you’re a manager onboarding a new employee, Workspace saves you the time and effort involved in writing that first welcome email. From there, you can elaborate upon or abbreviate the message or adjust the tone to be more playful or professional — all in just a few clicks. We’ll be rolling out these new experiences to testers in the coming weeks.`,

      'From groundbreaking AI advancements to revolutionary renewable energy solutions, technology is transforming the way we live and work. These innovations not only shape our present but also define the future, creating opportunities for a better, smarter, and more sustainable world for generations to come.',
    descript02: `Google has been investing in AI for many years and bringing its benefits to individuals, businesses and communities. Whether it’s publishing state-of-the-art research, building helpful products or developing tools and resources that enable others, we’re committed to making AI accessible to everyone.,
`,
    descript03: `We’re now at a pivotal moment in our AI journey. Breakthroughs in generative AI are fundamentally changing how people interact with technology — and at Google, we’ve been responsibly developing large language models so we can safely bring them to our products. Today, we’re excited to share our early progress. Developers and businesses can now try new APIs and products that make it easy, safe and scalable to start building with Google’s best AI models through Google Cloud and a new prototyping environment called MakerSuite. And in Google Workspace, we’re introducing new features that help people harness the power of generative AI to create, connect and collaborate.`,
    descripton04: `More than 3 billion people already benefit from AI-powered features in Google Workspace, whether it’s using Smart Compose in Gmail or auto-generated summaries in Google Docs. Now, we’re excited to take the next step and bring a limited set of trusted testers a new set of features that makes the process of writing even easier. In Gmail and Google Docs, you can simply type in a topic you’d like to write about, and a draft will be instantly generated for you. So if you’re a manager onboarding a new employee, Workspace saves you the time and effort involved in writing that first welcome email. From there, you can elaborate upon or abbreviate the message or adjust the tone to be more playful or professional — all in just a few clicks. We’ll be rolling out these new experiences to testers in the coming weeks.`,
